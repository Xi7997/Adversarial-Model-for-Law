The following is the text of a legal event, please help me summarize the following content:
1. Fact Description: Summarize the case in a concise text, no more than 500 words. Note that the fact description should include only a description of events and not any opinion of the court.
2. Plaintiff's claim: A concise description of the plaintiff's initial claim, no more than 200 words.
3. Judgement: Analyze and extract the final verdict from the text, and the output contains only one of the following labels:
    - "Granted"
    - "Denied"
    - "Partially granted"
 Your output should follow the format BELOW:
 {{
  "Fact Description": [YOUR ANSWERS],
  "Plaintiff's claim": [YOUR ANSWERS],
  "Judgement": [ONE OF THE THREE LABELS ABOVE]
  }}
  Note that if the result of the event cannot be summarized by the above three labels, ONLY output "NONE".
